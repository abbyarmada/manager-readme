# My Manager Readme

## Why

Every manager is different. In an effort to share a bit of how I operate as a manager, and what I expect of you as your manager, I adopted this practice based on a few others around:

- [Lara Hogan]
- [John Cline]
- Leslie Borrell

## Communication

- Managing my team is my top priority, so I will always make time for you when you need it.
- The best way to talk to me if we are not next to each other is Slack
  - I treat Slack very asynchronously. If I can't respond right away, I will set a reminder and respond later
  - I keep my do not disturb set up intentionally so that when I am out of the office, it is on. Feel free to drop messages in there while I am in DnD mode and I will respond in the morning. If it is urgent, feel free to break through the DnD wall.
- I check email throughout the day and try to stay on top of it. If you request my review on a pull request on Github or something, I will get an email - you don't need to Slack me as well. If I'm not responding as quickly as you would like, feel free to ping me

### When I'm out of the office (vacation, sick, weekends, etc.)

- When I am out of the office, I generally set up DnD in Slack for the whole duration of my absence. This is intentional so that you can break through the wall and get in touch of me if needed.
- I generally don't check email when I am out of the office (including evenings and weekends). Please hit me up in Slack or by phone if you need me.

## Working hours

- Most days I am in the office around 9:30. I leave around 5:45 or 6:00 in the evening.
- If I am late or need to leave early, I will update the team in Slack. 
- If I am leaving early, I will also put an "OOO" event on my calendar.

## Calendar events

- My role generally requires me to go to a lot of meetings. I try to keep my calendar up to date. If I am double-booked, I will make sure to reject one of the events.
- If there is an open spot in my calendar, feel free to send me an invite
- If my day starts to get too full, I will put a block event on the calendar. I'd prefer not to take more meetings at that point and will reject any that come in, but if you need me urgently to attend, let me know and I will.

## 1:1s

- I think 1:1 meetings are a very important part of our relationship.
- 1:1s are your time for feedback, guidance, context, venting, or anything you want to discuss.
- You should come prepared with things you want to discuss. I may occasionally have things to cover as well, but your topics are the priority.
- I book an hour every 2 weeks for our 1:1s. We likely won't use the full time every time, but I have found it is very useful to have the full hour when we need it.
- If you need to move a 1:1, let me know and I will find another time that works.

## My values

- **People First**: I think that the people on the team are the most important part of what we do, and will always think of the team's well-being first when I am working on a new process or making a decision.
- **Try It And See (TIAS)**: We are free to experiment and try things. I generally think it is better to work towards something we can try and iterate on than spending time developing the "best" or "perfect" solution to a problem.
- **Lean Teams**: I have seen what small teams can accomplish, and like to find new ways for us to work well together before trying to expand the team.
- **Empowerment**: I care that everyone has the ability to make decisions and share their opinions. To that end, I try to listen more, speak less, and ask questions, to give you the space to come up with a decision, rather than telling you an answer.

## Finding Opportunities

A big part of my management philosophy revolves around finding opportunities for the people on my team. To that end, I try to keep abreast of people's interests and career goals, to find projects and roles that will further those goals and interests. I am generally willing to take a slight hit on speed of delivery for a project if it means that we can grow as a team by sharing knowledge more.

## A few things I'm pretty good at

- Interviewing and hiring
- Developing and iterating on processes
- People and Personnel Dynamics
- Project Management
